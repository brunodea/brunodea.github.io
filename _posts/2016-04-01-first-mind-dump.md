<img src="/images/fulls/2016-04-01-image1.jpg" class="fit image"> Hello World! This is the first post of my first personal blog. I intend to write about *life, the universe and everything else*, that is, **anything**!

My name is Bruno Romero de Azevedo, I am currently 24 years old and I have a Masters degree in Computer Science (more info in my [LinkedIn](https://br.linkedin.com/in/brunode) page). The image in the beginning of this post is a picture I took in 2014 of a toy I used to play as a child. Since it brings so good memories, it seems fitting for the start of this blog.

Anyway, my life is about to change drastically soon. For the first time ever I will be living by myself and in a completely different city (SÃ£o Paulo/SP). I am sure that it will be a great opportunity for interesting blog posts, so my new adventures will probably be a hot topic here!

That is it for now! Thanks for following along and see you soon.
